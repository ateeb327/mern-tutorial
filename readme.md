# Goalsetter MERN app
This is the forked copy of Original GoalSetter app from bradtraversy.
I have added Dockerfile and DockerCompose so that we can deploy this app
using Docker. 

This is the goalsetter app from the [Learn the MERN Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0exw-9YJBo) series on YouTube.
COmplete information about installation of this MERN app on local PC can also be 
found at [Linux Server Setup & MERN App Deployment](https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/b8b72581ddc940e0a41e0bc09172d91b)

## Usage
Docker must be installed on your system.
Just go into the mern-tutorial directory and run the following command:

### Install dependencies

```
# Backend deps
npm install

# Frontend deps
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run Server

```
npm run server
```

## Demo

I am not sure how long this will be up
